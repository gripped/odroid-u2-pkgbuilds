    <h2>
      Google Chrome OS Terms
    </h2>
    <p>
      BY USING THIS DEVICE, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE FOLLOWING TERMS. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO
      THESE TERMS, RETURN THE DEVICE IN ACCORDANCE WITH ITS RETURN POLICY.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Chrome OS device provided to you includes Chrome OS software, such as the operating
      system executable code, embedded software, firmware, fonts, and other data, including any
      updates (referred to collectively as the <strong>“Software”</strong>). These Terms apply to
      the Software and your use of the Software with your Chrome OS device. Source code for Chrome
      OS is available free of charge under open source software license agreements at
      www.chromium.org.
    </p>
    <h3>
      1. Your relationship with Google
    </h3>
    <p>
      1.1 Your use of the Software and your use of the Software with Google’s products, software,
      services and web sites (referred to collectively as the <strong>“Services”</strong> in this
      document and excluding any services provided to you by Google under a separate written
      agreement) is subject to the terms of a legal agreement between you and Google. “Google”
      means Google Inc., whose principal place of business is at 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway,
      Mountain View, CA 94043, United States. This document explains how the agreement is made up,
      and sets out some of the terms of that agreement.
    </p>
    <p>
      1.2 Unless otherwise agreed in writing with Google, your agreement with Google will always
      include, at a minimum, the terms and conditions set out in this document. These are referred
      to below as the <strong>“Universal Terms”</strong>. Open source software licenses for Chrome
      OS source code constitute separate written agreements. To the limited extent that the open
      source software licenses expressly supersede these Universal Terms, the open source licenses
      govern your agreement with Google for the use of Chrome OS or specific included components of
      Chrome OS.
    </p>
    <p>
      1.3 Your agreement with Google will also include the the terms set forth below in the Chrome
      OS Additional Terms and terms of any Legal Notices applicable to the Services, in addition to
      the Universal Terms. All of these are referred to below as the <strong>“Additional
      Terms”</strong>. Where Additional Terms apply to a Service, these will be accessible for you
      to read either within, or through your use of, that Service.
    </p>
    <p>
      1.4 The Universal Terms, together with the Additional Terms, form a legally binding agreement
      between you and Google in relation to your use of the Software and Services. It is important
      that you take the time to read them carefully. Collectively, this legal agreement is referred
      to below as the <strong>“Terms”</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      1.5 If there is any contradiction between what the Additional Terms say and what the
      Universal Terms say, then the Additional Terms shall take precedence in relation to that
      Service or that component of the Software.
    </p>
    <h3>
      2. Accepting the Terms
    </h3>
    <p>
      2.1 In order to use the Software, you must first agree to the Terms. You may not use the
      Software if you do not accept the Terms.
    </p>
    <p>
      2.2 You can accept the Terms by:
    </p>
    <p>
      (A) clicking to accept or agree to the Terms, where this option is made available to you by
      Google in the user interface; or
    </p>
    <p>
      (B) by actually using the Software. In this case, you understand and agree that Google will
      treat your use of the Software as acceptance of the Terms from that point onwards.
    </p>
    <h3>
      3. License from Google
    </h3>
    <p>
      3.1 Google gives you a limited non-exclusive license to use the Software, and any updates
      provided to you by Google, on the Chrome OS device provided to you. This license is for the
      sole purpose of enabling you to use and enjoy the Software as provided by Google, in the
      manner permitted by the Terms.
    </p>
    <p>
      3.2 Subject to section 1.2, you may not (and you may not permit anyone else to) copy, modify,
      create a derivative work of, reverse engineer, decompile or otherwise attempt to extract the
      source code of the Software or any part thereof, unless this is expressly permitted or
      required by law, or unless you have been specifically told that you may do so by Google, in
      writing.
    </p>
    <p>
      3.3 Subject to section 1.2, unless Google has given you specific written permission to do so,
      you may not assign (or grant a sub-license of) your rights to use the Software, grant a
      security interest in or over your rights to use the Software, or otherwise transfer any part
      of your rights to use the Software.
    </p>
    <h3>
      4. Software updates
    </h3>
    <p>
      4.1 The Software may automatically download and install updates from time to time from
      Google. These updates are designed to improve, enhance and further develop the Software and
      may take the form of bug fixes, enhanced functions, new software modules and completely new
      versions. You agree to receive such updates (and permit Google to deliver these to you) as
      part of your use of the Software.
    </p>
    <h3>
      5. Apps, Extensions, and Themes
    </h3>
    <p>
      5.1 These terms in this section apply if you install apps, extensions, or themes in the
      Software. Apps are web applications, developed by Google or third parties, that you can
      install in Chrome OS. Extensions are small software programs, developed by Google or third
      parties, that can modify and enhance the functionality of the Chrome OS. Themes are a special
      kind of extension that changes the way the Software looks. Extensions and apps may have
      greater privileges to access your browser or your computer than regular webpages, including
      the ability to read and modify your private data.
    </p>
    <p>
      5.2 From time to time, Chrome OS may check with remote servers (hosted by Google or by third
      parties) for available updates to apps and extensions, including but not limited to bug fixes
      or enhanced functionality. You agree that such updates will be automatically requested,
      downloaded, and installed without further notice to you.
    </p>
    <p>
      5.3 From time to time, Google may discover an app or extension that violates Google developer
      terms or other legal agreements, laws, regulations or policies. Chrome OS will periodically
      download a list of such apps and extensions from Google’s servers. You agree that Google may
      remotely disable or remove any such app or extension from user systems in its sole
      discretion.
    </p>
    <h3>
      6. Provision of the Services by Google
    </h3>
    <p>
      6.1 Google has subsidiaries and affiliated legal entities around the world
      (<strong>“Subsidiaries and Affiliates”</strong>). Sometimes, these companies will be
      providing the Services to you on behalf of Google itself. You acknowledge and agree that
      Subsidiaries and Affiliates will be entitled to provide the Services to you.
    </p>
    <p>
      6.2 Google is constantly innovating in order to provide the best possible experience for its
      users. You acknowledge and agree that the form and nature of the Services which Google
      provides may change from time to time without prior notice to you.
    </p>
    <p>
      6.3 As part of this continuing innovation, you acknowledge and agree that Google may stop
      (permanently or temporarily) providing the Services (or any features within the Services) to
      you or to users generally at Google’s sole discretion, without prior notice to you. You may
      stop using the Services at any time. You do not need to specifically inform Google when you
      stop using the Services.
    </p>
    <p>
      6.4 You acknowledge and agree that if Google disables access to your account, you may be
      prevented from accessing the Services, your account details or any files or other content
      which is contained in your account.
    </p>
    <h3>
      7. Use of the Services by you
    </h3>
    <p>
      7.1 You agree to use the Services only for purposes that are permitted by (a) the Terms and
      (b) any applicable law, regulation or generally accepted practices or guidelines in the
      relevant jurisdictions (including any laws regarding the export of data or software to and
      from the United States or other relevant countries).
    </p>
    <p>
      7.2 You agree that you will not engage in any activity that interferes with or disrupts the
      Services (or the servers and networks which are connected to the Services).
    </p>
    <p>
      7.3 Unless you have been specifically permitted to do so in a separate agreement with Google,
      you agree that you will not reproduce, duplicate, copy, sell, trade or resell the Services
      for any purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      7.4 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to
      you or to any third party for) any breach of your obligations under the Terms and for the
      consequences (including any loss or damage which Google may suffer) of any such breach.
    </p>
    <h3>
      8. Privacy and your personal information
    </h3>
    <p>
      8.1 For information about Google’s data protection practices, please read Google’s privacy
      policy at http://www.google.com/privacy.html and at
      http://www.google.com/chromeos/intl/en/privacy.html. This policy explains how Google treats
      your personal information, and protects your privacy, when you use the Software and the
      Services.

    </p>
    <h3>
      9. Content in the Services
    </h3>
    <p>
      9.1 You understand that all information (such as data files, written text, computer software,
      music, audio files or other sounds, photographs, videos or other images) which you may have
      access to as part of, or through your use of, the Services are the sole responsibility of the
      person from which such content originated. All such information is referred to below as the
      <strong>“Content”</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      9.2 You should be aware that Content presented to you as part of the Services, including but
      not limited to advertisements in the Services and sponsored Content within the Services may
      be protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by the sponsors or advertisers
      who provide that Content to Google (or by other persons or companies on their behalf). You
      may not modify, rent, lease, loan, sell, distribute or create derivative works based on this
      Content (either in whole or in part) unless you have been specifically told that you may do
      so by Google or by the owners of that Content, in a separate agreement.
    </p>
    <p>
      9.3 Google reserves the right (but shall have no obligation) to pre-screen, review, flag,
      filter, modify, refuse or remove any or all Content from any Service. For some of the
      Services, Google may provide tools to filter out explicit sexual content. These tools include
      the SafeSearch preference settings (see http://www.google.com/help/customize.html#safe). In
      addition, there are commercially available services and software to limit access to material
      that you may find objectionable.
    </p>
    <p>
      9.4 You understand that by using the Services you may be exposed to Content that you may find
      offensive, indecent or objectionable and that, in this respect, you use the Services at your
      own risk.
    </p>
    <p>
      9.5 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to
      you or to any third party for) any Content that you create, transmit or display while using
      the Services and for the consequences of your actions (including any loss or damage which
      Google may suffer) by doing so. You retain copyright and any other rights you already hold in
      Content which you submit, post or display on or through, the Services.
    </p>
    <h3>
      10. Proprietary rights
    </h3>
    <p>
      10.1 You acknowledge and agree that Google (or Google’s licensors) own all legal right, title
      and interest in and to the Software and the Services, including any intellectual property
      rights which subsist in the Software and the Services (whether those rights happen to be
      registered or not, and wherever in the world those rights may exist).
    </p>
    <p>
      10.2 Unless you have agreed otherwise in writing with Google, nothing in the Terms gives you
      a right to use any of Google’s trade names, trade marks, service marks, logos, domain names,
      and other distinctive brand features.
    </p>
    <p>
      10.3 If you have been given an explicit right to use any of these brand features in a
      separate written agreement with Google, then you agree that your use of such features shall
      be in compliance with that agreement, any applicable provisions of the Terms, and Google's
      brand feature use guidelines as updated from time to time. These guidelines can be viewed
      online at http://www.google.com/permissions/guidelines.html (or such other URL as Google may
      provide for this purpose from time to time).
    </p>
    <p>
      10.4 Google acknowledges and agrees that it obtains no right, title or interest from you (or
      your licensors) under these Terms in or to any Content that you submit, post, transmit or
      display on, or through, the Services, including any intellectual property rights which
      subsist in that Content (whether those rights happen to be registered or not, and wherever in
      the world those rights may exist). Unless you have agreed otherwise in writing with Google,
      you agree that you are responsible for protecting and enforcing those rights and that Google
      has no obligation to do so on your behalf.
    </p>
    <p>
      10.5 You agree that you shall not remove, obscure, or alter any proprietary rights notices
      (including copyright and trade mark notices) which may be affixed to or contained within the
      Software or the Services.
    </p>
    <p>
      10.6 Unless you have been expressly authorized to do so in writing by Google, you agree that
      in using the Services, you will not use any trade mark, service mark, trade name, logo of any
      company or organization in a way that is likely or intended to cause confusion about the
      owner or authorized user of such marks, names or logos.

      below.
    </p>
    <p>
      11.2 Google may at any time, terminate its legal agreement with you if:
    </p>
    <p>
      (A) you have breached any provision of the Terms (or have acted in manner which clearly shows
      that you do not intend to, or are unable to comply with the provisions of the Terms); or
    </p>
    <p>
      (B) Google is required to do so by law (for example, where the provision of the Software or
      Services to you is, or becomes, unlawful); or
    </p>
    <p>
      (C) the partner with whom Google offered the Software or Services to you has terminated its
      relationship with Google or ceased to offer the Software or Services to you; or
    </p>
    <p>
      (D) Google is transitioning to no longer providing the Software or Services to users in the
      country in which you are resident or from which you use the service; or
    </p>
    <p>
      (E) the provision of the Software or Services to you by Google is, in Google’s opinion, no
      longer commercially viable.
    </p>
    <p>
      11.3 Nothing in this Section shall affect Google’s rights regarding provision of Software or
      Services under Section 6 of the Terms.
    </p>
    <p>

      that you and Google have benefited from, been subject to (or which have accrued over time
      whilst the Terms have been in force) or which are expressed to continue indefinitely, shall
      be unaffected by this cessation, and the provisions of paragraph 19.7 shall continue to apply
      to such rights, obligations and liabilities indefinitely.

      WARRANTY OR LIABILITY FOR LOSSES WHICH MAY NOT BE LAWFULLY EXCLUDED OR LIMITED BY APPLICABLE
      LAW. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF CERTAIN WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OR THE
      LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY FOR LOSS OR DAMAGE CAUSED BY NEGLIGENCE, BREACH OF
      CONTRACT OR BREACH OF IMPLIED TERMS, OR INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES. ACCORDINGLY,
      ONLY THE LIMITATIONS WHICH ARE LAWFUL IN YOUR JURISDICTION WILL APPLY TO YOU AND OUR

      SERVICES IS DONE AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK AND THAT YOU WILL BE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR
      ANY DAMAGE TO YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEM OR OTHER DEVICE OR LOSS OF DATA THAT RESULTS FROM THE
      DOWNLOAD OF ANY SUCH MATERIAL.
    </p>
    <p>
      12.5 NO ADVICE OR INFORMATION, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, OBTAINED BY YOU FROM GOOGLE OR
      THROUGH OR FROM THE SOFTWARE AND SERVICES SHALL CREATE ANY WARRANTY NOT EXPRESSLY STATED IN
      THE TERMS.
    </p>
    <p>
      12.6 GOOGLE FURTHER EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, WHETHER
      EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF
      MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.

      http://www.google.com/chromeos/intl/en/eula_text.html and any new Additional Terms will be
      made available to you from within, or through, the affected Software or Services.
    </p>
    <p>
      18.2 You understand and agree that if you use the Software or Services after the date on
      which the Universal Terms or Additional Terms have changed, Google will treat your use as
      acceptance of the updated Universal Terms or Additional Terms.
    </p>
    <h3>
      19. General legal terms
    </h3>
    <p>
      19.1 Sometimes when you use the Services, you may (as a result of, or in connection with your
      use of the Services) use a service or download a piece of software, or purchase goods, which
      are provided by another person or company. Your use of these other services, software or
      goods may be subject to separate terms between you and the company or person concerned. If
      so, the Terms do not affect your legal relationship with these other companies or
      individuals.
    </p>
    <p>
      19.2 The Terms constitute the whole legal agreement between you and Google and govern your
      use of the Software or Services (but excluding any services which Google may provide to you
      under a separate written agreement), and completely replace any prior agreements between you
      and Google in relation to the Software and Services.
    </p>
    <p>
      19.3 You agree that Google may provide you with notices, including those regarding changes to
      the Terms, by email, regular mail, or postings on the Services.
    </p>
    <p>
      19.4 You agree that if Google does not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy which is
      contained in the Terms (or which Google has the benefit of under any applicable law), this
      will not be taken to be a formal waiver of Google’s rights and that those rights or remedies
      will still be available to Google.
    </p>
    <p>
      19.5 If any court of law, having the jurisdiction to decide on this matter, rules that any
      provision of these Terms is invalid, then that provision will be removed from the Terms
      without affecting the rest of the Terms. The remaining provisions of the Terms will continue
      to be valid and enforceable.
    </p>
    <p>
      19.6 You acknowledge and agree that each member of the group of companies of which Google is
      the parent shall be third party beneficiaries to the Terms and that such other companies
      shall be entitled to directly enforce, and rely upon, any provision of the Terms which
      confers a benefit on (or rights in favor of) them. Other than this, no other person or
      company shall be third party beneficiaries to the Terms.
    </p>
    <p>
      19.7 The Terms, and your relationship with Google under the Terms, shall be governed by the
      laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of laws provisions. You and
      Google agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located within the county
      of Santa Clara, California to resolve any legal matter arising from the Terms.
      Notwithstanding this, you agree that Google shall still be allowed to apply for injunctive
      remedies (or an equivalent type of urgent legal relief) in any jurisdiction.
